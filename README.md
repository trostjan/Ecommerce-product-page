## Overview

E-commerce single product page. Practicing my javascript skills, aswell as css (scss). 
Looking forward on building a multisite e-commerce website with different products, as I found this challenge to be fairly easy since I could skip many tricky parts since I only had one product to work with.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Scss
- javaScript
